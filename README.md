## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to build a responsive blog preview card that matches the provided designs for mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px) layouts. The card includes an image, a category tag, a publication date, a title with a hover state, a description, and an author section with an avatar. The design also features custom border styling with thicker borders on the right and bottom.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup (e.g., `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<img>`, `<a>`)
- CSS custom properties for colors and spacing
- Flexbox for layout and alignment
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts: Figtree

### What I Learned

This project helped me solidify several key skills:

- **Semantic HTML**: Using `<article>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>` improved the structure and accessibility of the card. For example:
  ```html
  <article class="card">
    <header>
      <span class="tag">Learning</span>
      <p class="published-date">Published 21 Dec 2023</p>
    </header>
    <h2 class="title"><a href="#">HTML & CSS foundations</a></h2>
    <p class="description">These languages are the backbone of every website, defining structure, content, and presentation.</p>
    <footer class="author">
      <img src="./assets/images/image-avatar.webp" alt="Greg Hooper" class="avatar">
      <span class="author-name">Greg Hooper</span>
    </footer>
  </article>
  ```
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the card scales properly from 320px to large screens using percentage-based widths and `max-width`.
- **Custom Borders**: Applying different border widths to specific sides of the card using `border-width: 1px 8px 8px 1px`.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped me master Flexbox for this layout.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Used to import the Figtree font for the project.
